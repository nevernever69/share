## Project Title: CLOUD FORENSICS VIRTUAL LAB

#### Our idea of a Cloud Forensics Virtual Lab is all about providing hands on training & exciting challenges based on various cloud forensic instances coupled with the convenience of a unified platform, having Practical Challenges, Comprehensive Lab Manuals, Detailed Solutions, Tips & Best Practices, Command Execution Interface all under one roof.

## Problem Solved:
Need for Hands-On Training:
Skill Gaps in the Workforce: Many cybersecurity professionals lack practical experience with cloud
forensics tools, hindering their effectiveness in real-world investigations.
Inefficient Traditional Training Methods: Traditional classroom settings focus on theoretical knowledge
without providing adequate hands-on opportunities to apply skills in realistic scenarios.
Limitations in Forensic Analysis:
Cloud-Native Architectures: Traditional forensic methods struggle to adapt to the dynamic and
distributed nature of cloud environments, complicating evidence collection.
Lack of Standardized Methodologies: Investigators often lack clear protocols for incident response in
cloud settings, leading to inconsistencies in investigations.
Inaccessibility of Realistic Training Environments:
Limited Resources: Existing training tools may not fully replicate the complexities of real-world cloud
environments, leaving students underprepared.
Cost and Accessibility Issues: High costs associated with cloud resources can restrict access to
effective training for students and professionals
